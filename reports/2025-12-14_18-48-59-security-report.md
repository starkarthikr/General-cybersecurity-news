#### **2. Notable Malware Families**
- **Emotet (Re-Emergence):**
  - **Behavior:** Returns with new evasion techniques, spreading via malicious Word/Excel attachments.
  - **Payload:** Delivers ransomware (e.g., Ryuk, Conti).
  - **Defense:** Block macros in Office files and disable remote desktop protocols (RDP).
- **QakBot (Qbot):**
  - **Behavior:** Spreads via infected Word docs, exfiltrates banking credentials.
  - **Tactics:** Uses anti-analysis techniques to evade detection.
  - **Defense:** Enable email filtering and deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR).

#### **3. Emerging Attack Vectors**
- **Supply Chain Attacks:**
  - **Threat:** Compromised third-party software (e.g., SolarWinds, Kaseya).
  - **Defense:** Monitor vendor security practices and conduct third-party risk assessments.
- **Deepfake Phishing:**
  - **Threat:** AI-generated audio/video impersonating executives to authorize fraudulent transactions.
  - **Defense:** Implement voice authentication and verify requests via secondary channels.
- **Zero-Day Exploits:**

    - **CVE-2023-23397 (Microsoft Outlook Zero-Day).**
  - **Defense:** Apply patches immediately and segment networks to limit spread.

---

#### **4. Recommended Actions**
- **Employee Training:** Conduct regular phishing simulations and security awareness programs.
- **Endpoint Protection:** Deploy advanced EDR/XDR solutions and enforce strict application whitelisting.
- **Network Monitoring:** Use SIEM tools to detect unusual traffic patterns.
