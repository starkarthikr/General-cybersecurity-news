GrayBravo demonstrates strong adaptability, responsiveness to public exposure, and operates a large-scale, multi-layered infrastructure. Recent analysis of GrayBravo’s ecosystem uncovered four distinct activity clusters leveraging the group’s CastleLoader malware, each defined by unique tactics, techniques, and victim profiles. These findings reinforce the assessment that GrayBravo operates a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.</p>\n        <p>For example, one cluster, tracked as TAG-160, impersonates global logistics firms, using phishing lures and the ClickFix technique to distribute CastleLoader while spoofing legitimate emails and exploiting freight-matching platforms to target victims. Another cluster, tracked as TAG-161, impersonates Booking.com, also employing ClickFix to deliver CastleLoader and Matanbuchus and novel phishing email management tools. Further investigation through historical panel analysis linked the online persona “Sparja”, a user active on Exploit Forums, to potential GrayBravo-associated activities, based on the alias’s distinctiveness and related discussion topics.</p>\n        <p>To protect against GrayBravo, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated loaders, infostealers, and remote access trojans (RATs), flag and potentially block connections to unusual legitimate internet services (LISs) such as Pastebin, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort, Sigma) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section for implementation guidance and <strong>Appendix H</strong> for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group uncovered four distinct activity clusters leveraging GrayBravo’s CastleLoader, each exhibiting unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and victim profiles, reinforcing the assessment that GrayBravo operates a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystem, as previously hypothesized.</li>\n          <li>One cluster, tracked as TAG-160, impersonates logistics firms and deploys phishing lures combined with the ClickFix technique to distribute CastleLoader, while spoofing legitimate emails and abusing freight-matching platforms to engage targets.</li>\n          <li>Cluster 2, tracked as TAG-161, impersonates Booking.com and uses ClickFix techniques to deliver CastleLoader and Matanbuchus, relying on threat actor-controlled infrastructure and employing previously unseen phishing email management tooling.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>In September 2025, Insikt Group <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/from-castleloader-to-castlerat-tag-150-advances-operations\">reported</a> on a newly identified threat actor, TAG-150, assessed to have been active since at least March 2025. Since our previous reporting, we have decided to classify TAG-150 as GrayBravo. It is believed to be responsible for developing multiple custom malware families, beginning with CastleLoader and CastleBot, and most recently, CastleRAT. It is characterized by rapid development cycles, technical sophistication, responsiveness to public reporting, and an expansive, evolving infrastructure. Alongside the discovery of the previously undocumented remote access trojan CastleRAT, Insikt Group identified GrayBravo’s multi-tiered infrastructure and its use of various supporting services, including file-sharing platforms and anti-detection tools.</p>\n        <p>Although public reporting has suggested that GrayBravo operates under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, supported by its delivery of diverse second-stage payloads, the proliferation of CastleLoader administration panels, and features typical of MaaS platforms, Insikt Group has not identified any advertisements or discussions of this service on underground forums. Recorded Future® Network Intelligence indicates that GrayBravo predominantly interacts with its own infrastructure, with only a limited number of external IP addresses, possibly representing customers or affiliates, observed communicating with it. Many of these connections are routed through Tor nodes, complicating attribution and classification.</p>\n        <p>Through continued monitoring, Insikt Group has identified multiple clusters of activity linked to GrayBravo, reinforcing the assessment that the threat actor is operating a MaaS ecosystem (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). This report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with these clusters, believed to represent potential GrayBravo customers or affiliates. More specifically, Insikt Group identified four clusters linked to GrayBravo’s CastleLoader activity: one targeting the logistics sector (TAG-160), another using Booking.com-themed lures across a wider range of victims (TAG-161), a third also impersonating Booking.com but independent from the previous group, and a fourth distributing CastleLoader through malvertising and fake software updates.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1206\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16f04fa4d373e431d0057b87c0fe966769aa4cac9.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Overview of GrayBravo and associated clusters (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Higher Tier Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group previously identified an extensive, multi-tiered infrastructure tied to GrayBravo. The infrastructure consists of Tier 1 victim-facing C2 servers associated with malware families such as CastleLoader, SecTopRAT, WarmCookie, and the newly discovered CastleRAT, as well as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 servers, the latter of which are likely used for backup purposes. <strong>Figure 2</strong> provides an overview of the infrastructure used by GrayBravo.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_135c5c1ab7869c6f3e602baab05488fd0d435962a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to GrayBravo (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h3>CastleRAT</h3>\n        <p>CastleRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) observed in both C and Python variants that share several core characteristics. Each variant communicates through a custom binary protocol secured with RC4 encryption and hard-coded sixteen-byte keys. Upon execution, CastleRAT queries a geolocation application programming interface (API) using <em>ip-api[.]com</em> to obtain victim geographic location and network details. Both variants support remote command execution, file download and execution, and establish an interactive remote shell. The C variant exhibits additional capabilities, including browser credential theft, keylogging, and screen capture functionality.</p>\n        <h4>Infrastructure Analysis</h4>\n        <p>Analysis of CastleRAT C-variant command-and-control (C2) infrastructure reveals notable operational overlap across multiple nodes sharing the RC4 key “NanuchkaUpyachka.” As illustrated in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, Insikt Group observed two CastleRAT C2 servers, <em>104[.]225[.]129[.]171</em> and <em>144[.]208[.]126[.]50</em>, maintain concurrent communications with at least three US-based victims, suggesting coordinated or redundant control channels. The overlapping traffic patterns, observed within the same daily collection windows, indicate that compromised hosts reached out to multiple C2s nearly simultaneously rather than migrating between them over time. This behavior implies a deliberate redundancy strategy employed by the threat actor. Additionally, direct communications between two CastleRAT C variants, <em>104[.]225[.]129[.]171</em> and <em>195[.]85[.]115[.]44</em>, further point to an interconnected infrastructure ecosystem rather than isolated C2 instances. Such internal connectivity could facilitate automated data synchronization, lateral control distribution, or key exchange mechanisms within the threat actor’s tooling, underscoring a more mature coordinated operational model than previously documented.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"938\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d32a10bffa6e0b7534ef42d38aba5855ac9b6537.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Victim communication with multiple CastleRAT C2 servers simultaneously (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Notably, some CastleRAT samples <a href=\"https://tria.ge/250918-qj9pha1nz4/behavioral1\">exhibit</a> behavior distinct from other observed variants by incorporating an elaborate handshake sequence and redundancy in their C2 communications. In these cases, the client’s initial request to the C2 server (for example, <em>77[.]238[.]241[.]203:443</em>) ends with the bytes <code>07 00 00 00</code> instead of the usual <code>01 00 00 00</code>, and the server responds with trailing bytes <code>9e ff 74 70</code> before closing the connection. A similar exchange occurs with <em>5[.]35[.]44[.]176</em>, after which the client reconnects to the first C2, transmitting only an encrypted sixteen-byte RC4 key and receiving trailing bytes <code>01 00 00 00</code> in response. The client then repeats this process with the second C2, sending <code>01 00 00 00</code> and receiving only the encrypted sixteen-byte RC4 key in return. This pattern suggests the use of additional handshake stages and dual-C2 redundancy mechanisms not seen in all CastleRAT samples.</p>\n        <h4>Clustering by RC4 Key</h4>\n        <p>Analysis of CastleRAT infrastructure identified multiple clusters of IP addresses grouped by hard-coded RC4 encryption keys (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). While each RC4 key forms a distinct cluster, all clusters exhibit some degree of overlap through shared keys, suggesting a deliberate or coordinated relationship rather than a coincidental overlap. This interconnected structure suggests a shared tooling or deployment framework underpinning both CastleRAT and CastleLoader operations. Although this does not conclusively establish single-threat actor control, the degree overlap implies a common developer or operator ecosystem rather than independent, uncoordinated usage of the malware.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1390\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1be5107977c3267366984e116b333887daf9703ac.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong></em> <em>RC4 key clusters (Source: Recorded Future)</em>\n        </p>\n        <h3>CastleLoader</h3>\n        <h4>Infrastructure Analysis</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified additional C2 infrastructure associated with CastleLoader. The related domains and IP addresses are listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>. Notably, several domains share the same WHOIS start of authority (SOA) email address, indicating they were likely registered by the same threat actor.</p>\n        <p>Notably, the domain <em>oldspicenotsogood[.]shop</em> is linked to several other domains listed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>, which are likely used for malicious activity, including impersonation of legitimate brands such as DocuSign, Norton, and TradingView. Additionally, at least one of these domains, <em>testdomain123123[.]shop</em>, has been identified as a LummaC2 C2 server.</p>\n        <h3>Activity Clusters</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified four distinct clusters of activity associated with the deployment of CastleLoader (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). The first cluster, tracked as TAG-160, appears to be highly targeted toward the logistics sector, employing techniques specifically tailored to this industry. In contrast, the second cluster, tracked as TAG-161, exhibits a broader targeting scope and leverages Booking.com-themed lures. The third cluster likewise impersonates Booking.com but shows no overlap with TAG-161. The fourth cluster relies on malvertising campaigns and fake software update mechanisms.</p>\n        <p>Based on Insikt Group’s assessment, these clusters are associated with distinct users deploying CastleLoader, as no overlap in infrastructure or tactics was observed between them. At this stage, the exact nature of the relationship between these users and GrayBravo (formerly tracked as TAG-150) remains unclear. Insikt Group further assesses that additional CastleLoader users are likely active, supported by proprietary Recorded Future intelligence and the large number of identified panels, which collectively suggest a broader user base.</p>\n        <h4>Cluster 1: Logistics Sector-Focused Activity Tracked as TAG-160</h4>\n        <p>Cluster 1, tracked as TAG-160, has been active since at least March 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. TAG-160 employs infrastructure that impersonates logistics companies and leverages logistics-themed phishing lures, among other tactics. It uses ClickFix techniques to deliver CastleLoader, among additional payloads. Evidence suggests the cluster operates a mix of threat actor-controlled and -compromised infrastructure. Additionally, it has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in target organizations’ systems, such as spoofing legitimate email senders from logistics companies to enhance the credibility of its phishing campaigns. In addition, Cluster 1 uses access to the legitimate freight-matching platforms DAT Freight &amp; Analytics and Loadlink Technologies for multiple purposes.</p>\n        <h5>Attack Flow</h5>\n        <p>Cluster 1 employs spearphishing campaigns in combination with ClickFix techniques to compromise victims. <strong>Figure 5</strong> illustrates a high-level overview of the phishing attack flow.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a3fbdc837ac260e056768d86ba670ab247081c07.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 5</strong>: ClickFix attack flow used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>The attack chain typically begins with either a spoofed legitimate email address (for example, <em>no-reply[@]englandlogistics[.]com</em>) or a threat actor-controlled address associated with a typosquatted domain (for example, <em>englandloglstics[.]com</em>), impersonating companies such as England Logistics. Historically, such emails have been sent to US-based carriers, presenting fraudulent freight quotes that appear to originate from England Logistics. However, other organizations likely to be influenced by logistics-themed lures cannot be ruled out as potential targets.</p>\n        <p>The emails prompt recipients to click a link to view a supposed rate confirmation for a shipment, instructing them to copy and paste the link into a browser if it does not open directly. The threat actors often add a sense of urgency, warning that the link will soon expire. Clicking the link leads victims to a landing page designed to harvest information (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>). Insikt Group has <a href=\"https://www.urlquery.net/report/99d39dd3-bfd6-44fa-9275-e7d7e7a22ac9\">observed</a> multiple variations of these landing pages.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1052\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_155561bfb43adf9b6751ba6800e35c480f96c98ed.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"966\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 6</strong>: “dpeforms” lure used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Notably, although Insikt Group was unable to retrieve the landing page associated with another Cluster 1–linked domain, <em>loadstracking[.]com</em>, indexed Google search results indicate that the domain likely hosted the same or a similar page as observed in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. DPE likely stands for “Direct Port Entry,” which is a system designed for exporters, allowing goods to be directly moved from their premises to the port and loaded onto the vessel for export without being transferred to a container freight station.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a43f26ffef45a6c789ad537c5e1232e719f5353f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"743\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 7</strong>: “dpeforms” page found in Google Search (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>After submitting their information, the victim is presented with ClickFix-style instructions, guiding them through a series of steps purportedly required to complete a document signing process (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>). By incorporating the DocuSign logo, the threat actors likely aim to enhance the perceived legitimacy of the page and further deceive the victim.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a29b8734977ac6a714e89ce057ad87cfbcb12c81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 8</strong>: DocuSign-themed ClickFix used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>By following the instructions shown in <strong>Figure 8</strong>, the victim unknowingly executes the command illustrated in <strong>Figure 9</strong>. This command runs silently in the background, downloads and extracts a payload archive from a remote IP address, executes a Python-based malware using <code>pythonw.exe</code>, and displays a decoy message to appear legitimate. Observed payloads delivered through this method include CastleLoader, HijackLoader, Rhadamanthys, and zgRAT.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_194d883d95935fed30bcd62de8a8aa760b4f8dd9d.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1262\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 9</strong>: ClickFix command (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h5>Use of Compromised Infrastructure</h5>\n        <p>As part of TAG-160’s phishing infrastructure, the threat actors appear to rely not only on spoofed email addresses, as previously described, but also on compromised systems. Insikt Group has observed indications that the threat actors likely leveraged compromised infrastructure to send phishing emails. For example, at least one domain used to distribute phishing messages contained malware logs from infostealers such as LummaC2, including stolen credentials for a Namecheap account.</p>\n        <h5>Infrastructure Analysis</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified a large number of domains and IP addresses associated with Cluster 1, all of which either impersonate logistics companies or align with logistics-themed phishing lures (see <strong>Appendix C</strong>). Notably, the majority of these domains include the subdomain <em>apps[.]englandlogistics</em> (for example, <em>apps[.]englandlogistics[.]rateconfirmations[.]com</em>), suggesting they were likely designed to impersonate England Logistics, as outlined in the previous section. One domain, <em>loadstrucking[.]com</em>, instead featured the subdomain <em>app[.]england</em>, following a similar naming pattern.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0197f23f-1845-74dd-90af-539a30c3aa3e\">identified</a> the subdomain <em>files[.]loadstracking[.]com</em>, hosted on the IP address <em>89[.]185[.]84[.]211</em> between July 6 and September 26, 2025, which was serving the file <code>newtag.zip</code> (SHA256: d87ccd5a2911e46a1efbc0ef0cfe095f136de98df055eacd1c82de76ae6fecec). The ZIP folder contained a legitimate WinGup executable for Notepad++ that sideloaded a malicious libcurl.dll identified as DonutLoader. This loader subsequently retrieved three intermediate payloads from the legitimate subdomain <em>files-accl[.]zohoexternal[.]com</em>.</p>\n        <h5>Domain Re-Registration Tactic</h5>\n        <p>Similarly, Insikt Group assesses that to further enhance the perceived legitimacy of their infrastructure, the threat actor deliberately re-registered domains previously associated with legitimate logistics companies, in addition to using typosquatted domains. <strong>Figure 10</strong> provides two examples of this activity.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img alt=\"\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1767d51180ebfc148db82f1ef427279295a0b4538.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1082\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 10</strong>: Re-registration of logistics-themed domains (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Notably, the domain <em>cdlfreightlogistics[.]com</em> appears to have previously hosted a website associated with the legitimate company CDL Freight Logistics, Inc. in 2023. Similarly, the domain <em>hometownlogisticsllc[.]com</em> hosted a website for Hometown Logistics LLC in 2021 (see <strong>Figure 11</strong>).</p>\n        <div></div>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 11</strong>: Registration of domains previously owned by legitimate logistics companies (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h5>Public Complaints and Suspected Access to DAT and Loadlink</h5>\n        <p>Some of the domains listed in the <strong>Infrastructure Analysis</strong> section have been publicly referenced in connection with suspicious or fraudulent activity. For example, the email address <em>david[@]cdlfreightlogistics[.]com</em>, associated with the domain <em>cdlfreightlogistics[.]com</em>, first appeared on August 26, 2025, in a public Telegram channel named “current_hot_loads”, a forum used by individuals and companies in the logistics industry to share information such as market rates. In that instance, a user asked other members whether an email was legitimate (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>). Several respondents indicated they did not believe it to be legitimate.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1416daca3dfc49f61ff3c646109de20af7819dbea.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"800\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 12:</strong></em> <em>Example phishing email sent by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>While Insikt Group was unable to obtain additional details about the email exchange linked to the email posted in the channel, the available text suggests that the threat actor initially contacted potential victims without including malicious content, likely aiming to establish rapport before sending follow-up messages containing malicious links.</p>\n        <p>In another instance, Insikt Group identified a post from an employee of a legitimate logistics company based in Rhode Island, USA, describing an incident in which a threat actor created accounts impersonating their company on DAT Freight &amp; Analytics (<em>dat.com</em>) and Loadlink Technologies (<em>loadlink.ca</em>), both platforms operating in the freight matching industry (see <strong>Figure 13</strong>). The fraudulent registrations used fake company information, including the email address <em>paul[@]mrlogsol[.]ca</em>, which is associated with Cluster 1–linked infrastructure. Notably, in line with Cluster 1’s typical patterns, the email addresses used in these operations often consist of only a first name (for example, Paul). The employee reported having contacted both DAT and Loadlink to alert them to the fraudulent activity.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_197d2097858ae7d6502840ec86c8d25d764e75569.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"890\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 13</strong>: Complaint on Facebook written by an individual targeted by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Based on a confirmation email from one of the platforms’ abuse reporting teams, which the employee shared on Facebook as well, it appears that the threat actor was also using a Gmail address impersonating their company, <em>maritza[.]rmlogisticsol[@]gmail[.]com</em> (see <strong>Figure 14</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"988\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_101b71323b17bacddaaeb2ba1f64855fb611f5936.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1128\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 14</strong>: Email shared by an individual targeted by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Threat actors associated with Cluster 1 appear to have access to fraudulent DAT and Loadlink accounts, as evidenced by a user report of fraudulent activity on Facebook (see <strong>Figure 13</strong>) and further supported by additional profiles identified by Insikt Group (see <strong>Figure 15</strong>). Furthermore, Insikt Group assesses that the threat actors may also have access to compromised legitimate accounts, given the substantial volume of stolen credentials associated with the domains <em>dat[.]com</em> and <em>loadlink[.]ca</em> observed in Recorded Future Identity Intelligence.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1eb360521afb816016f9bf42b54a29065e55cd924.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1280\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 15</strong>: Account information linked to TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Access to platforms like DAT Freight &amp; Analytics and Loadlink Technologies not only enables the threat actors to enhance the appearance of legitimacy, allowing them to maintain plausible profiles should potential victims attempt verification, but also provides opportunities to gather contact information for prospective targets and obtain additional contextual data, such as details on specific loads, dates and times, documents, or related materials, which can then be repurposed as spearphishing lures. In addition, although not verified in this specific case, the threat actors may also post fraudulent load listings containing malicious content, potentially resulting in malware infections.</p>\n        <h5>Possible Overlap with September 2024 Campaign</h5>\n        <p>In September 2024, Proofpoint <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-actor-uses-compromised-accounts-customized-social-engineering\">reported</a> on an unattributed activity cluster observed since at least May 2024. The threat actors targeted transportation and logistics companies in North America to distribute various malware families, including LummaC2, StealC, and NetSupport RAT, as well as remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as SimpleHelp, PDQ Connect, Fleetdeck, and ScreenConnect. The campaigns employed several techniques: The threat actors compromised legitimate email accounts belonging to transportation and shipping companies, injecting malicious content into existing email threads to enhance credibility. They also used compromised accounts on DAT Freight &amp; Analytics and Loadlink platforms to post fraudulent load listings containing malicious URLs leading to RMM downloads. Lastly, they launched broader phishing waves that directed recipients to staging web pages hosting RMM installers. Most campaigns involved Google Drive URLs or attached .URL shortcut files that, when executed, used SMB to retrieve an executable from a remote share, leading to malware installation.</p>\n        <p>While Insikt Group has not identified direct technical overlaps (for example, shared infrastructure), the similar targeting and partially overlapping tactics, particularly the use of DAT Freight &amp; Analytics and Loadlink, suggest a possible connection between this activity cluster and Cluster 1 (this is a low-confidence assessment).</p>\n        <p>Notably, in November 2025, Proofpoint <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/remote-access-real-cargo-cybercriminals-targeting-trucking-and-logistics\">reported</a> again on a possibly related activity where cybercriminals targeted trucking and logistics companies using RMM tools to hijack shipments. The attackers lured victims through fake load postings or compromised email threads, delivering malware or RMM software to gain access. This campaign highlights the growing convergence of cyber and physical cargo theft as criminals exploit digital logistics systems.</p>\n        <h4>Cluster 2: Matanbuchus and Mailer Tool Activity Tracked as TAG-161</h4>\n        <p>Cluster 2, tracked as TAG-161, has been active since at least June 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. The cluster leverages infrastructure impersonating Booking.com and employs ClickFix techniques. It primarily delivers CastleLoader and other payloads, including Matanbuchus. Notably, Insikt Group observed this cluster using Matanbuchus. Evidence indicates that the cluster relies mainly on threat actor-controlled infrastructure. Furthermore, Insikt Group identified a previously unreported phishing email management tooling, which appears to be used by threat actors linked to Cluster 2.</p>\n        <h5>Matanbuchus Activity and Booking.com-Themed Infrastructure</h5>\n        <p>Alongside CastleLoader, several Matanbuchus samples were distributed through Booking.com-themed ClickFix campaigns associated with Cluster 2. Notably, Insikt Group had previously reported Matanbuchus activity linked to CastleRAT in an earlier publication, where the Matanbuchus C2 panel was hosted on the adjacent IP address, <em>185[.]39[.]19[.]164</em> (see <strong>Figure 16</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fee0f400f126652867b44778e0424c29d3f6aac1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 16</strong>: Matanbuchus panel on</em> 185[.]39[.]19[.]164 <em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Matanbuchus is a C-based downloader MaaS available since 2021.

This IP address was also associated with the domain <em>nicewk[.]com</em>, previously <a href=\"https://www.morphisec.com/blog/ransomware-threat-matanbuchus-3-0-maas-levels-up/\">reported</a> by Morphisec. Historical analysis of the same IP revealed several additional Matanbuchus C2 domains, including <em>galaxioflow[.]com</em> and <em>nimbusvaults[.]com</em>.</p>\n        <h5>Additional Booking.com-Themed Infrastructure</h5>\n        <p>By analyzing the same /24 CIDR range that hosted the Matanbuchus infrastructure during the period of observed activity, Insikt Group identified additional IP addresses and domains linked to Booking.com-themed ClickFix operations. These network indicators, detailed in <strong>Appendix D</strong>, are tracked by Insikt Group as part of Cluster 2.</p>\n        <h5>Phishing Email Management Tooling</h5>\n        <p>By analyzing the IP addresses hosting the domains listed in <strong>Appendix D</strong>, Insikt Group identified three that stood out for each hosting three previously unreported websites or management panels operating on high ports. The panels featured the following HTML titles: “Менеджер Email”, “Менеджер Редиректов и рассылок”, and “Менеджер Редиректов и Email” (translated as “Redirect and Email Manager”). Based on their visual appearance, technical implementation, and thematic focus, Insikt Group assesses that these websites are used in tandem as part of campaigns specifically targeting Booking.com.</p>\n        <h5>Website 1: Redirect and Email Manager (“Менеджер Редиректов и Email”)</h5>\n        <p>The first website, <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0199c9ff-8739-76c3-b84e-a6c997c2e901\">hosted</a> on port 56723, serves as a web-based interface for managing bulk redirections and email campaigns (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>). It integrates redirect generation, SMTP configuration, and email distribution capabilities within a single dashboard. The design, terminology, and functionality closely align with those typically observed in malspam or phishing infrastructure management panels.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_136c896a9d13593c36ce2ff3aa14bf18009f7b8df.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /><em><strong>Figure 17</strong>: Page linked to “Redirect and Email Manager” tool (Source: Recorded Future)</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Within the document object model (DOM) of the website, Insikt Group identified two email addresses, with one of them being likely a compromised account used to send phishing emails. At the time of discovery, the rambler email address, likely a burner account, appeared within the page’s SMTP configuration with associated credentials, indicating its use as the primary sender account for automated bulk email delivery, consistent with the panel’s design for coordinated phishing or spam distribution. The DOM also contained an AWS access key.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, the DOM referenced a set of domains, some of which are listed in <strong>Appendix D</strong>, while others were newly identified and are listed in <strong>Appendix E</strong>. By searching for the phrase “Сервис редиректов работает для [domain]” (translated as “The redirect service works for [domain]”), Insikt Group discovered further related domains, likewise shown in <strong>Appendix E</strong>.</p>\n        <h5>Website 2: Email Manager (“Менеджер Email”)</h5>\n        <p>The second website, <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0199c9ff-89fc-7485-9c2c-d9124361dc00\">hosted</a> on port 56724, closely resembles the first “Redirect and Mailing Manager” panel but exhibits several notable configuration differences (see <strong>Figure 18</strong>). These include a distinct AWS username, an SMTP sender address, <em>bred[@]booking-porta[.]com</em>, as well as different logging settings and a few additional indicators of compromise. Furthermore, the website specified <em>109[.]104[.]153[.]87</em> as its proxy server.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1dd3b5b946434f96299c400d804be3d2845722bc0.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /><em><strong>Figure 18</strong>: Page linked to “Email Manager” tool (Source: Recorded Future)</em>\n        </p>\n        <h5>Website 3: Booking-Mailer V2.2 (“Менеджер Редиректов и рассылок”)</h5>\n        <p>The third website, <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0199c9ff-8cbc-7029-b6ab-dfcc24a26c96\">hosted</a> on port 56725, features a substantially larger DOM and functions as a combined redirect generator and mass-mailing platform (see <strong>Figure 19</strong>). The user interface exposes key capabilities, including domain selection, subdomain base-name configuration, HTML email templating (supporting URL placeholders for generated redirects), target file uploads, worker/thread management, SMTP pool configuration and validation, proxy editing, and real-time logging and statistics.

Both ASes were established on March 11, 2025, and have demonstrated consistent malicious activity since their inception. According to researchers at DeepCode, these providers <a href=\"https://decodecybercrime.com/bearhost-bulletproof-hosting-network-same-playbook-new-fronts/\">maintain</a> strong links to the BEARHOST bulletproof hosting network, a known enabler of malicious cyber operations. BEARHOST and associated providers have reportedly serviced ransomware operations, including LockBit, Conti, MedusaLocker, as well as sanctioned entities such as Garantex, Lazarus Group, Zservers, and Nobitex. That same research further identified malicious activity and customer bases linked to both AS211659 and AS216341, consistent with Insikt Group’s own observations of Lumma, Rhadamanthys, and Matanbuchus within these autonomous systems. This overlap in observed threats reinforces the assessment that both autonomous systems are part of a broader BEARHOST-aligned infrastructure ecosystem supporting financially motivated cyber operations.</p>\n        <h5>Infrastructure Similarities with TAG-157 (RefBroker)</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group has previously reported on threat actors impersonating Booking.com, including TAG-157, also known as RefBroker. Notably, domains associated with TAG-157 have been observed hosted on IP address <em>77[.]83[.]207[.]56</em>, adjacent to <em>77[.]83[.]207[.]55</em>, with the latter being part of TAG-161’s infrastructure. More broadly, both TAG-157 and TAG-161 appear to favor the same set of ASNs discussed in the section <strong>ASN Cluster Possibly Linked to Bearhost</strong>. At present, however, the exact relationship between TAG-157 and TAG-161 remains unclear.</p>\n        <h4>Cluster 3: Booking.com Impersonation Activity</h4>\n        <p>Cluster 3 has been active since at least March 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. The cluster leverages infrastructure impersonating Booking.com, ClickFix techniques, and uses Steam Community pages as a dead drop resolver to deliver CastleRAT via CastleLoader. Although the techniques appear similar to those described in Cluster 2, Insikt Group has not identified any technical overlaps between Clusters 2 and 3 at this time.</p>\n        <h5>Infrastructure Analysis</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group noted a CastleRAT <a href=\"https://tria.ge/250818-vhng4awks9/behavioral2\">sample</a> that leveraged a Booking.com phishing domain, <em>update-info4468765[.]com</em> (see <strong>Figure 20</strong>)<em>.</em> The phishing domain tricks users into running a malicious PowerShell command (via ClickFix techniques) that downloads a second-stage script from <em>boiksal[.]com/upd</em>. This script retrieves and executes a .NET loader that repeatedly spawns new PowerShell processes to add Windows Defender exclusions for the eventual payload (<code>update.exe</code>) using a User Account Control (UAC) prompt flooding loop to bypass analysis sandboxes and security controls. Once exclusions are applied, the loader decrypts and launches the CastleLoader payload, which then reaches out to its C2 domain, <em>programsbookss[.]com</em>, resolved through a Steam Community profile. The use of Steam Community profiles allows attackers to update infrastructure dynamically without redeploying malware (see <strong>Figure 21</strong>). CastleRAT samples that use Steam for deaddrops may sometimes contain a hard-coded backup C2 in the event the deaddrop C2 retrieval fails. A list of all observed Steam Community profiles and the various C2 domains observed on each is found in <strong>Appendix F.</strong></p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1493\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11fc64af5fa19c4f74249b006eab3899fe29a0281.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 20</strong>: GrayBravo’s CastleRAT using Steam Community for dead drop resolving (Source: Steam)</em></p>\n        <p>At the time of analysis, <em>update-info4468765[.]com</em> and <em>boiksal[.]com</em> were both hosted on <em>178[.]17[.]57[.]103</em>, while the Steam-resolved C2 domain, <em>programsbookss[.]com</em>, was hosted on an adjacent IP, <em>178[.]17[.]57[.]102</em>. This close placement within the same /24 subnet suggests that the operators likely acquired these IP addresses around the same time. It also suggests that they were assigned sequentially by the hosting provider, Global Connectivity Solutions (AS215540). A similar pattern was later observed across the <em>192[.]109[.]138[.]0/24</em> range, where Booking.com-themed phishing domains were hosted on <em>192[.]109[.]138[.]103</em> and the Steam-resolved C2 domains, <em>programsbookss[.]com</em> and <em>justnewdmain[.]com</em>, were hosted on <em>192[.]109[.]138[.]102</em>.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"1015\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b8336b05390165b9d107f8417922fed7d97dacc5.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 21</strong>: Booking.com-themed ClickFix linked to Cluster 3 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>When scanned, the Booking.com-themed domains typically return either a Cloudflare-themed turnstile page or a “turnstile token missing” error message (<a href=\"https://pro.urlscan.io/result/0198f318-4860-7256-9c58-74307bfe89d0\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.urlscan.io/result/0198e28c-2350-7217-ad05-ebd6694c5fc2\">2</a>). Further pivoting from the domain <em>boiksal[.]com</em> uncovered a broader cluster of activity encompassing multiple additional domains and IP addresses, most of which appear to be used to impersonate Booking.com. The domains and associated IP addresses are detailed in <strong>Appendix G</strong>. Notably, while the domains commonly use Cloudflare name servers, many of the domains ultimately resolve to threat actor–controlled IP addresses.</p>\n        <h4>Cluster 4: Malvertising and Fake Software</h4>\n        <p>Cluster 4 has been active since at least April 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. This cluster employs malvertising and fake software installers, impersonating legitimate tools such as Zabbix and RVTools, to distribute CastleLoader and NetSupport RAT.</p>\n        <p>Based on Insik Group observations, the cluster has used CastleLoader C2 infrastructure hosted on domains including <em>wereatwar[.]com</em>. It has also deployed NetSupport RAT samples that communicate with C2 servers at IP addresses such as <em>37[.]230[.]62[.]235</em> and <em>84[.]200[.]81[.]32</em>. Notably, the domain <em>jshanoi[.]com</em> resolved to these NetSupport-associated IP addresses during the period of activity.</p>\n        <p>The CastleLoader payloads are distributed through fake GitHub repositories and delivered as electronically signed MSI installers, often bearing Extended Validation (EV) certificates, similar to those <a href=\"https://x.com/g0njxa/status/1980943290896630209/photo/3\">observed</a> in previous Bumblebee campaigns. These signed builds have been attributed to organizations including LLC KHD GROUP (issued by GlobalSign) and INTYNA EXIM PRIVATE LIMITED (issued by SSL.com), among others. Notably, “Sparja”, an Exploit Forum user discussed below and potentially linked to CastleLoader, has been active in discussions regarding EV certificates earlier this year.</p>\n        <h3>Possible Connection to Exploit Forum User Sparja</h3>\n        <p>Analysis of <a href=\"https://tria.ge/250520-yvkthsbr2s\">historical</a> CastleLoader infrastructure identified one anomalous instance that may indicate a link to a threat actor named “Sparja”. A panel hosted on <em>94[.]159[.]113[.]123</em> and exposed on port 5050 diverged from established CastleLoader panel characteristics. While known CastleLoader administrative interfaces typically display the HTML title “Castle,” this instance returned the title “Sparja.” Review of the panel’s DOM file revealed that it referenced a CSS file with a filename identical to one observed in verified CastleLoader panels. While the overlap does not constitute a conclusive stylistic correlation, it can suggest potential code reuse or reliance on a shared panel template between CastleLoader and the “Sparja” interface. Insikt Group identified one other Sparja panel with the same HTML title on the IP address <em>94[.]159[.]113[.]32</em> (see <strong>Figure 22</strong>)<em>.</em></p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1694a57896b2a72600c74c531634a7f93ce34875f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1258\" />\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_158f591d974d66fb741ee6789a74a8c861cd0c09f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1258\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 22:</strong></em> <em>Sparja panel (top) and CastleLoader panel (bottom) (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Activity associated with the alias “Sparja” on the underground Exploit Forum provides additional context for possible connections. Obtained via proprietary means, Insikt Group assesses that Sparja is also active on the top-tier Russian-language forum XSS. Insikt Group bases this assessment on the user’s XSS activity, in which the user viewed similar topics related to malware loaders, EV certificates, and bypass software.</p>\n        <p>On December 22, 2024, Sparja authored a thread on Exploit Forum, looking to buy or rent a dropper (see <strong>Figure 23</strong>). In a documented dispute spanning from January to February 2025, Sparja engaged a user known as “ppro” to develop a “private solution, a dropper or loader for an executable file.” The dispute concluded with ppro’s ban from the forum, following a history of earlier account suspensions and reinstatements. Given the timeline of the events, Insikt Group assesses it is unlikely ppr0 had involvement in CastleLoader’s development; however, Sparja’s expressed interest in acquiring a custom loader prior to CastleLoader’s appearance supports the assessment that Sparja was actively pursuing a dropper or loader functionality consistent with CastleLoader’s purpose.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c30437beb16bf10e993ab55c126b207e27dcf839.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"767\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><em><strong>Figure 23:</strong></em> <em>Sparja in search of a dropper or loader on Exploit Forum (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Forum discussions in October 2025 indicate continued interest in Sparja’s apparent tooling (see <strong>Figure 24</strong>). A subsequent post sought contact with “the coder who wrote the Sparja dropper,” implying that a distinct dropper associated with Sparja had circulated within the underground market. This activity’s timeline aligns with CastleLoader operations and suggests that Sparja’s development or procurement of loader-type malware was known among peers during the same operational period.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img alt=\"\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_19420a3499ba40af372c0899cb96c5e2a7642dac2.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"983\" /><em><strong>Figure 24:</strong></em> <em>Exploit Forum user “tomri99le” looking for the coder that worked with Sparja (Source: Recorded Future)</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>A <a href=\"https://tria.ge/250520-yvkthsbr2s/behavioral1\">related</a> CastleLoader sample, distributed as an MSI installer, was <a href=\"https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/8f3fc820def7b492876b38d021c904aafc60c379e8ad58cac81eee05bf41ee77/\">identified</a> in Bazaar Abuse data as originating from the GitHub account <em>github[.]com/legend123451111</em>. The same account appears in a Cisco Talos <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/maas-operation-using-emmenhtal-and-amadey-linked-to-threats-against-ukrainian-entities/\">report</a> describing a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystem leveraging GitHub for payload distribution, including malware families such as Amadey and Emmenhtal. Talos noted consistent naming conventions, repository structures, and file types across multiple associated GitHub accounts, with the earliest activity dated to January 2025. The report concluded that the operators of these accounts likely facilitated multi-tenant malware distribution rather than single-threat actor campaigns.</p>\n        <p>The available evidence does not confirm that Sparja directly participated in the MaaS network described by Talos; however, the CastleLoader sample that originated from <em>github[.]com/legend1234561111</em>, which contained the MSI installer, is linked to the Sparja-named CastleLoader panel, indicating a potential overlap between the GitHub-based distribution channel and infrastructure associated with Sparja. This connection suggests that Sparja may have either used an existing MaaS framework to distribute CastleLoader payloads or operated within the same delivery ecosystem.</p>\n        <p>On October 27, 2025, Sparja posted a comment on Exploit Forum within a thread advertising eDragon_x’s dropper service, stating that they had been using the service for several months and considered the dropper reliable. This post is notable as it reinforces Sparja’s continued interest in droppers and loaders, a recurring theme in their activity. The post also situates Sparja in proximity to eDragon_x, a threat actor operating within overlapping underground circles that include “tramp”, a known threat actor <a href=\"https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/11791-black-basta-ransomware-leader-slips-away-from-courtroom\">reportedly</a> identified as Oleg Nefedov. Tramp is associated with a spamming network responsible for <a href=\"https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1892636346885235092\">distributing</a> Qbot (aka Qakbot) and is identified as the founder of the BlackBasta ransomware group. Tramp was also an affiliate for several ransomware operations, such as REvil and Conti; he also maintained close ties with Rhysida and Cactus.</p>\n        <p>While there is no direct evidence of collaboration between Sparja and tramp, the shared participation across related forums and service providers like eDragon_x suggests that Sparja operates within a network of threat actors closely associated with major ransomware distribution and loader development ecosystems.</p>\n        <h3>Victimology</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified numerous suspected victim IP addresses communicating with the Tier 1 C2 infrastructure associated with CastleRAT. While the majority of these IP addresses appear to be geolocated in the United States, only a limited number of actual victims could be positively identified. Most victims remain unidentified and cannot be confirmed; however, Insikt Group assesses it is likely that at least some of them represent private individuals who became infected. It is important to note that of the entities Insikt Group identified, the infection might have occurred on individual machines within the network of the victim organization or by using the victim’s WiFi rather than on the organization's network directly. For instance, within the university context, it is likely that some victims are individual machines, such as those used by students, connected to the university's network.</p>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Leverage the IoCs in <strong>Appendix H</strong> to investigate potential past or ongoing infections, both successful and attempted, and use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor for future IoCs associated with GrayBravo (formerly tracked as TAG-150), TAG-160, TAG-161, and other threat actors.</li>\n          <li>Monitor for validated infrastructure associated with the malware families discussed in this report, including CastleLoader, CastleRAT, Matanbuchus, and numerous others identified and validated by Insikt Group, and integrate these indicators into relevant detection and monitoring systems.</li>\n          <li>Leverage Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules provided in <strong>Appendices I</strong>, <strong>J</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, <strong>L</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, <strong>N</strong>, and <strong>O</strong> in your SIEM or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect the presence or execution of CastleLoader, CastleRAT, and Matanbuchus.

This trend highlights how technically advanced and adaptive tooling, particularly from a threat actor with GrayBravo’s reputation, can rapidly proliferate within the cybercriminal ecosystem once proven effective. Given GrayBravo’s established history of developing and deploying custom malware families, it is highly likely the group will continue to release new tools and capabilities in the near term, further strengthening its position within the MaaS market.</p>\n        <p>Among observed activity clusters, TAG-160 stands out for its highly targeted campaigns against the logistics sector. The cluster demonstrates a deep understanding of industry operations, impersonating legitimate logistics firms, exploiting freight-matching platforms, and mirroring authentic communications to enhance its deception and impact. This indicates an increasing sophistication among niche, sector-specific threat actors who maintain a low profile through minimal footprints and precise targeting.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group will continue to closely monitor GrayBravo along with related threat actors, such as TAG-160 and TAG-161, to detect emerging threats and evaluate the group’s strategic direction within the broader
