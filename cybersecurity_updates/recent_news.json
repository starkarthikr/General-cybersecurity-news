The article reveals how the technology transformed inconsistent, analyst-dependent threat hunting into unified, automated operations—enabling junior analysts to run 15–20 hunts weekly and allowing our CISO to launch comprehensive network hunts in five minutes in response to critical threats like Salt Typhoon. By understanding these outcomes, security leaders can see how autonomous threat hunting empowers teams at every skill level to shift from reactive to proactive defense.",
